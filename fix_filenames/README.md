# Fix filenames

Rename all files inside a directory with the following rules:

- Replace whitespaces with underscores.
- Remove characters that are not alphanumerics, hyphens, underscores, or dots.
- If a file ends with ".sh" and is executable, remove the ".sh" extension. [Reason](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#file-extensions)
