# File integrity checker

Check the integrity of a file based on the Hash provided by the source.

# How to use

Run the script with:
```
$ python3 file_integrity_checker.py
```
Enter the directory where the file is located:
```
$ Enter the directory path to check integrity: ~/Downloads/dir_example/
```
The output would be something like this:
```
$ File: path/to/file
$ Hash: hashexample
```

The hash **MUST** coincide with the provided by the source
